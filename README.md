# IGP-2020-Group1

Year long masters group project (6 members) for which I was the project leader, I unfortunately had to withdraw from my course 8 weeks before the end however I was involved in all aspects up until that point. The remaining members all received first class grades for the work and I would of achieved the same.

The purpose of the program is to identify and then reidentify vehicles without using numberplates or images of the occupants and employs various computer vision techniques to do so.

Deployed on a jetson nano with a connection to a server to handle data and user interface.
